# Domang

_Domang_ (pronounced "doh mahng" and means _getaway_ or _escape_) is the codebase for a MEAN web app that shows nearby real-time transit options based on  geolocation in Washington, D.C. The Node.js/Express backend draws on the [local transit agency APIs](https://developer.wmata.com/) and caches some bus data in Mongo for performance reasons. An Angular frontend renders the map with Leaflet using the [AngularUI Leaflet module/directive](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-leaflet/).

Domang is a work very much in progress.
